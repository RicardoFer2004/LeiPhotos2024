Note: Since this repository represents the 1st project of my course's Object Oriented Development subject, 
a small ammount of classes were not authored by me, but rather by my professor. These classes are mostly the ones related to UI.
I do not have ownership of any class that has the tag "@author antonialopes" or "@author malopes".
